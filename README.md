Hereâ€™s a sample README file that explains the structure and components of your Spring Boot-based Todo List application using Hibernate and MySQL:

# Todo List Application

This is a simple Todo List application developed using **Spring Boot**, **Hibernate**, and **MySQL**. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items. Each item consists of a **title** and **description**.

## Overview

This application provides a RESTful API for managing a Todo list. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on todo items, which are stored in a MySQL database using Hibernate for ORM mapping.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based applications.
- **Hibernate**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for database interaction.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for persisting todo items.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Data access layer for interaction with MySQL through Hibernate.
- **Spring Web**: To expose the REST API endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following:

- **JDK 11** or higher
- **MySQL** database running locally or on a remote server.
- **Maven** for dependency management and project build.
- **IDE** such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for easier development.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd todo-list-application
   ```

2. **Configure Database**:

   In `application.properties`, configure your MySQL database connection details.

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/todo_db
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=root
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Application**:

   Build and run the application using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Verify**:

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`. You can use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to interact with the API.

## Endpoints

### 1. `GET /todos`
Retrieve all todo items.

**Example Request:**

```http
GET http://localhost:8080/todos
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Sample Todo",
    "description": "This is a sample todo item"
  }
]
```

### 2. `GET /todos/{id}`
Retrieve a single todo item by its ID.

**Example Request:**

```http
GET http://localhost:8080/todos/1
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Sample Todo",
  "description": "This is a sample todo item"
}
```

### 3. `POST /todos`
Create a new todo item.

**Example Request:**

```http
POST http://localhost:8080/todos
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "title": "New Todo",
  "description": "This is a new todo item"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "title": "New Todo",
  "description": "This is a new todo item"
}
```

### 4. `PUT /todos/{id}`
Update an existing todo item by its ID.

**Example Request:**

```http
PUT http://localhost:8080/todos/1
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "title": "Updated Todo",
  "description": "This todo has been updated"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Updated Todo",
  "description": "This todo has been updated"
}
```

### 5. `DELETE /todos/{id}`
Delete a todo item by its ID.

**Example Request:**

```http
DELETE http://localhost:8080/todos/1
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Todo item with id 1 deleted successfully."
}
```

## Database Structure

The **Todo** entity is represented by the `todos` table in MySQL.

### `todos` table:

| Column      | Type         | Description                             |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| id          | INT          | Primary key, auto-increment             |
| title       | VARCHAR(255)  | Title of the todo item                  |
| description | TEXT         | Description of the todo item            |

## Example Requests

**1. Create a new Todo:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/todos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Learn Spring Boot", "description": "Complete the Spring Boot tutorial"}'
```

**2. Update a Todo:**

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/todos/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Learn Spring Boot", "description": "Complete the tutorial and deploy the app"}'
```
